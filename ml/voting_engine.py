ml/voting_engine.py — Voting & agreement system (Day 70)
==========================================================

Collects predictions from all AI brains (XGBoost, RF, LSTM, Rules) and
applies professional voting rules:

  Agreement | Action      | Position Size
  ----------|-------------|-------------
  4/4       | FULL        | 100% of calculated lot
  3/4       | HALF        | 50% of calculated lot
  2/4       | WAIT        | 0% (no trade)
  1/4       | NO_TRADE    | 0%
  0/4       | NO_TRADE    | 0%

The voting engine also detects "strong dissent" — when one model strongly
opposes the majority. In that case, even a 3/4 agreement is downgraded
to "reduced position" and a conflict warning is raised.

Output:
    {
        "decision": "BUY" | "SELL" | "WAIT" | "NO_TRADE",
        "agreement": "3/4",
        "agreement_count": 3,
        "total_models": 4,
        "position_size": "HALF",
        "position_multiplier": 0.5,
        "has_strong_dissent": bool,
        "dissenting_model": "lstm",
        "dissent_reason": "LSTM strongly opposes (SELL 80% vs majority BUY)",
    }

"""
intelligence/decision_score.py — Weighted factor scoring system
=================================================================

Day 67 — Professional multi-factor decision scoring.

Each analysis factor (SMC, Liquidity, Session, Currency Strength,
Intermarket, News, Technical) gets:
  * a **weight** (sum = 100%)
  * a **direction** (BUY / SELL / NEUTRAL)
  * a **strength** (0-100)
  * a **confidence** (0-100)

The weighted score produces a single 0-100 BUY score and 0-100 SELL score.
The difference determines the final direction.

Weight allocation (calibrated for institutional-style trading):
  SMC (Market Structure)     : 25%  ← institutional footprint
  Liquidity                  : 20%  ← where stops/resting orders are
  Currency Strength          : 15%  ← relative strength model
  Intermarket                : 15%  ← DXY/Gold/VIX confirmation
  News Intelligence          : 10%  ← fundamental bias
  Technical (RSI/MACD/EMA)   : 10%  ← momentum confirmation
  Session                    : 5%   ← time-of-day quality

Contradiction rule: if 2+ top-weight factors disagree strongly,
the confluence score is penalized (handled in signal_validator.py).
